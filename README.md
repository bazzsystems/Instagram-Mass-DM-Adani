<h2>About the Script:</h2>

This script is a simple automation that logs into your Instagram account and sends a direct message to a user or multiple users.
It uses the Selenium library to automate a web browser and send the message.
To use the script, you need to enter your Instagram username and password, as well as the username of the user you want to send a message to. You can also 
enter a list of multiple usernames in a text file and the script will send the message to all of the users in the list.

In order to run the script, you need to have the Selenium library installed and a web driver for your web browser (such as ChromeDriver for Google Chrome). 
You also need to make sure that your web browser and web driver are both up to date.
Overall, this script can be useful for automating repetitive tasks such as sending the same message to multiple users on Instagram.However, it is important 
to use this script responsibly and not spam other users with unwanted messages.
